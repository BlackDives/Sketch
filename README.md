# Sketch!
This is a vanilla JavaScript web application that I made as a part of following The Odin Project's online course for Web Development. This application allows you to draw by painting black squares as your mouse hovers around the screen .It took me about two hours to code the logic and about 20 minutes to do the minimal styling.

## `Functionality`
By default it generates an 8x8 grid and whenever your mouse hovers over a black square the color of the square will be automatically changed to red. Whenever you want to, you can change the size of the grid by clicking the reset button at the top of the screen. You will then be prompted to enter a single number that will be used to generate the NxN square dimensions.
